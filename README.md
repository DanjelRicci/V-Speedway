*Arcade racing for Oculus Quest!*

This is a playable alpha version of a project I'm developing in my free time. I'm very passionate about racing and there's not enough yet on Oculus Quest, so here we are!

The final idea of this game is inspired by classic games like *Screamer* or *Daytona USA*, with a bunch of nice cars, long tracks, and quick game modes. I'll keep the alpha public as I like to give players something to play right now, plus a full fledged demo once the final game will be out.
